# TestMax
TestMax app

The app has a basic screen with three cards. Clicking on them opens up the remaining questions as per the category. Tapping on the correct answer makes it green and if wrong, then red. The reset button on the main page clears all records of the responses saved. 
Also, each card has a review button too which lets the user (re)view his/her previous responses and how they performed. Questions will appear in random fashion based on the category and will reappear if skipped.

The app uses a local storage within the app (using basic data structures)
The excel file is stored in the assets folder and are read by importing jxl jar.
